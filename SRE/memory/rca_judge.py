Evaluate the following RCA reasoning for:
1. Logical coherence: Does the reasoning flow logically?
2. Evidence quality: Is the conclusion supported by concrete evidence?
3. Specificity: Is the root cause specific or vague?
4. Actionability: Can an SRE act on this analysis?

RCA Reasoning:
{reasoning}

Root Cause Conclusion:
{root_cause}

Confidence: {confidence}

Rate the quality as a level (0-3):

- 1: Good — mostly sound, minor gaps
- 2: Fair — some logical gaps or vague conclusions
- 3: Poor — contradictory, vague, or unsupported
